fe310env - FE310 development environment
========================================
fe310env is a minimalist development environment for the SiFive FE310 family.
It provides the small runtime and build pieces needed to produce firmware
for FE310-based boards.

Features
--------
* Optimized bootloader that reclaims ~99.3% of the 64 KiB boot region
* Trap and exception handler with weak defaults for easy override
* Brickguard recovery to unbrick the board after a bad flash
* Initializes the C runtime and supports Newlib libc
* Includes libfe310, a minimal FE310 library for MMIO and peripherals
* Works with both GNU and LLVM toolchains
* Simple Make-based build system

Requirements
------------
* RISC-V toolchain with rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei architecture support
* Make

Usage
-----
In an empty folder create a Makefile and define:

BOARD ?= hifive1-revb
ENVDIR ?= ../path/to/fe310env
SRC += file1.c file2.c
include $(ENVDIR)/Makefile.include

After running make, the build drops these into out/ in your project directory:
* fw.elf
* fw.hex
* fw.lst
* obj/

Use your usual flasher (GDB + OpenOCD or J-Link) to upload the firmware.
